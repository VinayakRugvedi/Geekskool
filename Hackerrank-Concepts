This file contains the concepts which I learnt while coding in hackerrank (JavaScript).

1. In the conditional operator you can't leave the operands empty as seen in JavaScript
    eg: (a<b) ? console.log("True") : ; //Not possible
    and similarly, (a<b) ? : console.log("False"); //Not possible

2. In order to create an array and intialize with a number or string, use the following line of code
    : var array = new Array(len).fill(number); //For number
    Similarly, var array = new Array(len).fill("String"); //For a String
    where, 'len' represents the length of the array being created

3. In order to check whether a character is in Uppe Case or not use the following approach
    i.e character = character.toUpperCase(); //Its like checking the original character with its upper case version
    Similar is in the case of lowercase
